# Aim Assistant

A legit-style aimbot for Roblox.

## History

I ([@thuarnel](https://github.com/thuarnel)) originally created this project in 2021 when I noticed that the copy I had of GameSense 1.25 (for Roblox) was buggy at the time. I decided to learn how it worked and created a new side project called GameSense Rewritten. I eventually wanted to use a new minimalist UI and so that was the birth of Aim Assistant. The script at it's core is based off the original GameSense code, but the visual look is my own creation.

## Features

* Automatic tacking and aiming at the nearest enemy player (from the mouse)
* FFA/Team mode toggle
* ESP toggle
* FOV and sensitivity adjustments
* User interface (UI) for configuration and controls
* Support for Phantom Forces

## Requirements

* Roblox account, sign up at [roblox.com](https://www.roblox.com/)
* A roblox game that has a team system or is custom made for the script
* **Solara** or similar
